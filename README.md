# Splunk Demo

Simple demo for splunk. Runs the splunk server, universal forwarder, and an nginx server to generate logs

## Requirements
* `docker`
* `docker-compose`
* `curl`

## Running the demo
Just run the following command:
```
./run.sh
```

If the script fails, it should be easy enough to run the steps from the script manually and figure out what went wrong
